# Lab 4 - Test Cases Documentation


### 1. Create Expense 
**Description:** This test checks if the expense name and cost are displayed correctly in the expense list after creating an expense, and if the total spent amount updates appropriately and the remaining budget is calculated correctly after adding the expense.

### 2. Delete Expense
**Description:** This test checks if an expense can be successfully removed from the UI, by first adding and confirming an expense and then removing it. It also checks the total spent amount reflects the removal of the expense, and the remaining budget updates correctly after an expense deletion.

### 3. Budget Balance Verification
**Description:** This test checks if the total budget equals the sum of total expenses and remaining balance at any point, by confirming the remaining balance and expense and then ensuring through local variables that their sum remains the budget defined at the start.
